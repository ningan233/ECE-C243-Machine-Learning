This indicates that there were 8 well-separated clusters of data points in 97-dimensional space.  However, we did not attempt to visualize these clusters due to the high dimensionality of the data.  Here, we will apply PCA to these same data ({\\tt Xplan}) to gain some intuition about why we were able to classify so well in Homework \\#4.  The data points are $x_k\\in\\mathbf{R}^{N}$ ($k=1,...,K$), where $N=97$ is the data dimensionality and $K=728$ is the number of data points. "
