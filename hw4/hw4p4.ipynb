    "## Background\n",
    "Neural prosthetic systems can be built based on classifying neural activity related to planning. As described in class, this is analogous to mapping patterns of neural activity to keys on a keyboard.\n",
    "In this problem, we will apply the results of Problems 1 and 2 to real neural data. The neural data were recorded using a 100-electrode array in premotor cortex of a macaque monkey1. The dataset can be found on CCLE as `ps4_realdata.mat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following describes the data format. The `.mat` file is loaded into Python as a dictionary with two keys: `train_trial` contains the training data and `test_trial` contains the test data. Each of these contains spike trains recorded simultaneously from 97 neurons while the monkey reached 91 times along each of 8 different reaching angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spike train recorded from the $i_{th}$ neuron on the $n_{th}$ trial of the $k_{th}$ reaching angle is accessed as \n",
    "\n",
    "`data['train_trial'][n,k][1][i,:]`\n",
    "\n",
    "where n = 0,...,90, k = 0,...,7, and i = 0, . . . , 96.  The [1] in between [n,k] and [i,:] does not mean anything for this assignment and is simply an \"artifact\" of how the data is structured. A spike train is represented as a sequence of zeros and ones, where time is discretized in 1 ms steps. A zero indicates that the neuron did not spike in the 1 ms bin, whereas a one indicates that the neuron spiked once in the 1 ms bin. The structure test trial has the same format as train trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each spike train is 700 ms long (and thus represented by an array of length 700).  This comprises a 200ms baseline period (before the reach target turned on), a 500ms planning period (after the reach target turned on).  Because it takes time for information about the reach target to arrive in premotor cortex (due to the time required for action potentials to propagate and for visual processing), we will ignore the first 150ms of the planning period.  *** FOR THIS PROBLEM, we will take spike counts for each neuron within a single 200ms bin starting 150ms after the reach target turns on. ***\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, to calculate firing rates, you will calculate it over the 200ms window: \n",
